HPP stock take:
    // Everything starts at stocktake at meatrite. (So the stock must be taken)
    // There should always just be one meatrite stock, you can have stock that says different times, but this will be a copy of the stock that is showing as the latest stock.
    ☐ Create a stocktake table, that takes one of each stock, and also the different batches.
        ☐ Fields should include:
            ☐ Product name
            ☐ Batch number
            ☐ Amount available
            ☐ Day packed
            ☐ Stock taken by
            ☐ Is product available to pick. (Maybe it is not cleared yet)
            ☐ Should it be closed for picking by default (Must first be cleared)
            ☐ At the products table, maybe make a window that gives a value of how much a product count can be out (differ) before throwing a flag
            ☐ After product count, make a "reconsiliation" window where you have to square all the differeces
    // Maybe make it so that it will take a batch code for each stock, and if there are two batch codes that are the same or "null" - 
    // then it will add them together, and if they are different, it will make a new item. 
    ☐ Create a "Load truck" module @2d
        ☐ Make a menu where you can pick your order
        ☐ Make a place where you can pick your truck number (Maybe more than one truck per route)
        ☐ When you have picked your route, it will load all the orders that needs to be loaded.
        ☐ You can then click on that order to load start loading it.
        ☐ After clicking on the order to load, it shows you what is needed, and next to it what is available
        ☐ You then have an up down arrow, so that when you press the up arrow at the stock side, it increases the truck stock, and decreases the factory stock.
        ☐ Arrows should have 1, 5, 10, 50 and "total needed" totals that you can choose from
        ☐ If there are different batches of a product, then those batches should all appear, but you should only be able to take of the
            ☐ first one, and when it is at zero, then go on to the next one.
    ☐ It should have borders around the stock showing if there is too little or too much.
    ☐ When you click on truck fininshed, it should add the items to the truck, along with its batch codes, and also update the
    ☐ factory stock. It should then put the stock on pre-hpp (but not checked in - maybe gray), when you unload the truck you will
    ☐ check what is on the truck with what the stock says, click a checkbox if it is alright, and it will turn green at pre-hpp.
    ☐ Then a stocktake is made at post-hpp, showing what was left the previous day, and everything at pre-hpp that can be picked from (or
    ☐ brought over from pre to post hpp might be a better way of saying it.)
    ☐ Then when the truck is loaded again, give the same truck laoding screen, but when you pick the route, it gets all the stock that
    ☐ is at hpp, you might have to use a new batch code, as this will be a new truck going from hpp with different products on it.
