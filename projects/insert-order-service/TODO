☐ Insert order todo list

    ☐ Todo
        ✔ Make sure that only numbers can be inserted into the amount box @done(19-08-07 14:58)
        ☐ Change meatrite heading name to green when the order is valid.
        ☐ Maybe put most used products at the top, from most to less.
        ☐ When deleting, put the product that is deleted back to the other side.
        ☐ Change DATABASE orderNumber to random
        ☐ Make sure in form that order was not inserted yet, check that order id is not the same as another, and maybe date and name as well
            ☐ If there is already an order, then insert the details for that order instead
        ☐ If an order fails, maybe add the orderDetails and the products back together so that a person can fix something and press submit again.
            ☐ At the moment when the order fails you can not insert again because you removed the "orders" property

    ☐ Requested features
        ☐ After an order was inserted, clear everything so that a person can just start with the new order
        ☐ Only have one day where you read in the order day. Every route comes with a default order day, which is maybe not neccesary
        ☐ Have a way to insert new clients/accounts
        ☐ Make deli's, butch and perish uniform, don't let some be "1" and others "butch"
        ☐ Do not connect clients to specific route, they change too much and do not always go out on the same route
        ☐ Make sure order number does not yet exist before entering order
        ☐ Allow Details to be available when you press a butotn, so that you can see all contact info, as well as all the orders

        ☐ Return only top 10 accountid results as not to overwhelm system when nothing is entered
        ☐ Have a button where you can see the history of items that have been bought previously, with an avarage as well, and buttons to just
            ☐ insert the amount they bought previously, maybe even the whole order (When it comes to shoprites)

    ☐ Step1
        ☐ Create menu that shows the timestamp and the day that you are on

    ☐ Step 2
        ☐ Create the account view, where you start typing an account name and select form the list
        ☐ Prob also create the order from that goes with the account select
