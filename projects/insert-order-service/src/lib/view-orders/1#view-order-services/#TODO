    ✔ This must include routeName, and how much weight (With and without crates) the route is. @done(19-08-27 14:46)
    ☐ The factory may also want to see all the products for the route, so maybe have a summary with routeWeight and totalWeight for all
        ☐ routes, and then also a dropdown to show all the products that will be ordered, and the total of all products.

    ☐ Let user click on a route, and then get the rest of the data for the route, like all the shops etc.
    ☐ And then when you can see all the shops, let a user click on a shop and bring up the order, so that you can change it as neccesary
    ☐ Here it should also be able to change a route to a different route, as well as move the route to a different day.
    ☐ Show the pnp order total as percentage against other totals
    ☐ Have an option to print out a route, so when you click print route, it will print all the orders in the route
