☐ Bugs
    ✔ PNP CSV excel sheet orders pulling in orders twice, and leaving others behind @done(19-08-29 11:53)
    ☐ Once you have pressed the "Insert CSV File" button, you can not use it again before refreshing (You can not use it on the same file
        ☐ but you can use it on a different file. It will be because the value is the same as the previous value (if you pick the same
        ☐ file, and because it did not change, it does nothing. So the solution is the clear the value back to '' after inserting)


✔ How to add new pnp product to excel insert list @done(20-08-28 08:18)
    ☐ If product has different barcode than we do:
        ☐ Go to 'convert-pnp-csv-data-factory.service' and add it to the 'productCode' list
    ☐ Go to 'convert-pnp-structure-to-orders.service' and add the product to the 'createPnPProduct' function (Use our product name, and not the pnp name)
    ☐ Make sure the products are entered into the tbl_productgroups table in every place where it should be. For instance PCV375 had to be inserted into 1,6,10,11 and 14
        ☐ Else it will not open when you click on a route to add or delete products in the "view-specific-order" menu
